Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the 
street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road.
The fairies dancing in front of the car window. 
The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.
A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked
outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking 
a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different
. The first snow of the year brought back the witches as the fairies
in the yard had to seek shelter to avoid the cold.

The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one 
in the area, but the light shining in his eyes proved him wrong. It
came from about 100 feet away and was shining so directly into his 
eyes he couldn't make out anything about the person holding the light. 
There was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his
pocket and pulled out a flashlight of his own that was much stronger 
than the one currently blinding him. He turned it on and pointed it 
into the stranger's eyes.
