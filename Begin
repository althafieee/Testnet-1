Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the 
street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road.
The fairies dancing in front of the car window. 
The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.
A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked
outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking 
a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different
. The first snow of the year brought back the witches as the fairies
in the yard had to seek shelter to avoid the cold.
